# Machine-Learning
This is repository where I will add my Machine Learning projects and researches
<br>

My first Jupyter notebook  'Introduction to Machine Learning' where I explained some basic concept of ML.<br>

In folder 'Logistic Regression' are projects where I use logistic regression for Machine learning to do classification predictions based on labeled data.<br>

In folder 'Linear Regression' are projects where I use linear regression for Machine learning to do regression predictions based on labeled data.

In folder 'CSV Files' I will put all csv files which I used in projects so that you can download it.<br>

Python libraries which I'm using :

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* scikit-learn
<br><br>

## Pandas <br>

Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.<br>
Install it with pip with command -> pip install pandas <br>

<br><br>

## Numpy <br>

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.<br>
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. <br>
Install it with pip with command -> pip install numpy <br>
Link --> https://numpy.org/
<br><br>

## Seaborn <br>

The seaborn package was developed based on the Matplotlib library. It is used to create more attractive and informative statistical graphics. While seaborn is a different package, it can also be used to develop the attractiveness of matplotlib graphics.<br>
Install it with pip with command -> pip install seaborn <br>

<br><br>


## Scikit-learn <br>

Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours, and it also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
Install it with pip with command -> pip install scikit-learn <br>
