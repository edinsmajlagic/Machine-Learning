# Machine-Learning
This is repository where I will add my Machine Learning projects and researches
<br>

My first Jupyter notebook  'Introduction to Machine Learning' where I explained some basic concept of ML.<br>

In folder 'Logistic Regression' are projects where I used logistic regression for Machine learning to make classification on labeled data.
