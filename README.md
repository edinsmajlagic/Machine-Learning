# Machine-Learning
This is repository where I will add my Machine Learning projects and researches
<br>

My first Jupyter notebook  'Introduction to Machine Learning' where I explained some basic concept of ML.<br>

In folder 'Logistic Regression' are projects where I use logistic regression for Machine learning to do classification predictions based on labeled data.

In folder 'CSV Files' I will put all csv files which I used in projects so that you can download it
