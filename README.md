# Machine-Learning
This is repository where I will add my Machine Learning projects and researches
<br>

My first Jupyter notebook  'Introduction to Machine Learning' where I explained some basic concept of ML.<br>

In folder 'Logistic Regression' are projects where I use logistic regression for Machine learning to do classification predictions based on labeled data.

In folder 'CSV Files' I will put all csv files which I used in projects so that you can download it.<br>

Python libraries which I'm using :

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* scikit-learn
<br><br>

## Pandas <br>

Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.<br>
