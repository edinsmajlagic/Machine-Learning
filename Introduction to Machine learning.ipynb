    " What is ML ?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.<br>\n",
    "It is a branch of <b>artificial intelligence</b> based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.<br><br>\n",
    "Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things—numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.<br><br>\n",
    "Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are <font color=white><b>supervised learning</b></font> and <font color=white><b>unsupervised learning</b></font> – but there are also other methods of machine learning.  <br> <br><br>\n",
    " Types of ML are :<br> \n",
    "   *  Supervised learning\n",
    "   *  Unsupervised learning\n",
    "   *  Semisupervised learning\n",
    "      (combination of Supervised and   Unsupervised)\n",
    "   *  Reinforcement learning \n",
    "<br> <br><br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b> Supervised learning</b> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    " In supervised learning, the most prevalent, the data is labeled to tell the machine exactly what patterns it should look for. \n",
    "  <br> <br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    " <b>Unsupervised learning</b> <br> \n",
    " \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the data has no labels. The machine just looks for whatever patterns it can find.\n",
    "Unsupervised techniques aren’t as popular because they have less obvious applications. Interestingly, they have gained traction in cybersecurity.\n",
    "  <br> <br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <b>Reinforcement learning</b> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have reinforcement learning, the latest frontier of machine learning. A reinforcement algorithm learns by trial and error to achieve a clear objective. It tries out lots of different things and is rewarded or penalized depending on whether its behaviors help or hinder it from reaching its objective. \n",
    "  <br> <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "All ML tasks can be observed as 'problems' so there are two types of 'problems' :\n",
    "*  <b>Classification </b>\n",
    "*  <b>Regression</b>\n",
    "  <br> <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <b>Classification </b> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The output variables are often called labels or categories. The mapping function predicts the class or category for a given observation.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an email of text can be classified as belonging to one of two classes: “spam“ and “not spam“.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "A classification problem requires that examples be classified into one of two or more classes.<br> \n",
    "A classification can have real-valued or discrete input variables.<br> \n",
    "A problem with two classes is often called a two-class or binary classification problem.<br> \n",
    "A problem with more than two classes is often called a multi-class classification problem.<br>\n",
    "A problem where an example is assigned multiple classes is called a multi-label classification problem.<br> <br> \n",
    "It is common for classification models to predict a continuous value as the probability of a given example belonging to each output class. The probabilities can be interpreted as the likelihood or confidence of a given example belonging to each class. A predicted probability can be converted into a class value by selecting the class label that has the highest probability.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a specific email of text may be assigned the probabilities of 0.1 as being “spam” and 0.9 as being “not spam”. We can convert these probabilities to a class label by selecting the “not spam” label as it has the highest predicted likelihood.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to estimate the skill of a classification predictive model, but perhaps the most common is to calculate the classification accuracy.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The classification accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified examples out of all predictions made.<br> <br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " #### <b>  Regression </b>  <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to a continuous output variable (y).<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous output variable is a real-value, such as an integer or floating point value. These are often quantities, such as amounts and sizes.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a house may be predicted to sell for a specific dollar value, perhaps in the range of \\\\$100,000 to \\\\$200,000.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression problem requires the prediction of a quantity.<br> \n",
    "A regression can have real valued or discrete input variables.<br> \n",
    "A problem with multiple input variables is often called a multivariate regression problem.<br> \n",
    "A regression problem where input variables are ordered by time is called a time series forecasting problem.<br> \n",
    "Because a regression predictive model predicts a quantity, the skill of the model must be reported as an error in those predictions.<br> <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to estimate the skill of a regression predictive model, but perhaps the most common is to calculate the root mean squared error, abbreviated by the acronym RMSE.<br> "
